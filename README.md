The _printf function is a custom version of the standard printf function in C programming language. It takes in a format string as the first argument, followed by a variable number of other arguments. The format string is used to specify how the other arguments should be printed.

Before doing anything else, the function checks if the format string passed in is null, and if it is, it immediately returns -1. This is to handle the case where no format string is provided.

The function then uses the va_list variable type to start accessing the variable number of arguments that were passed in after the format string. These arguments will be used according to the format specified in the format string.

The function then calls another function called parser, which takes in the format string, an array of structs called f_list and the va_list variable. The parser function uses the information provided to determine how to format the output string.

Once the parser function has finished running, it returns the total number of characters printed, which is stored in a variable called printed_chars. After this, the function ends the access to the variable arguments using va_end and returns the total number of characters printed. This is the final output of the _printf function.
